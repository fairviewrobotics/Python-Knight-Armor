    Use a rate gyro to return the robots heading relative to a starting position.
    The Gyro class tracks the robots heading based on the starting position. As
    the robot rotates the new heading is computed by integrating the rate of
    rotation returned by the sensor. When the class is instantiated, it does a
    short calibration routine where it samples the gyro while at rest to
    determine the default offset. This is subtracted from each sample to
    determine the heading.

    This class is for the digital ADXRS450 gyro sensor that connects via SPI.
