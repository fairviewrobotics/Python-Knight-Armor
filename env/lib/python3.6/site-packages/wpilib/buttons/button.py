    It is very easy to link a button to a command.  For instance, you could
    link the trigger button of a joystick to a "score" command.

    buttons on an operator interface as a common use case of the more
    generalized Trigger objects. This is a simple wrapper around Trigger with
    the method names renamed to fit the Button object use.
