            The Talon uses the following bounds for PWM values. These values
            should work reasonably well for most controllers, but if users
            experience issues such as asymmetric behavior around the deadband
            or inability to saturate the controller in either direction,
            calibration is recommended.  The calibration procedure can be
            found in the VictorSP User Manual.
