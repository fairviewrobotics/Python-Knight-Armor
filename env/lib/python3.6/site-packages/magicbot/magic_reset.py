    '''
        This marker indicates that this variable on a component will
        be reset to a default value after each time that execute is
        called.
        
        Example usage::
        
            class Component:
            
                foo = will_reset_to(False)
                
                def control_fn(self):
                    self.foo = True
                    
                def execute(self):
                    if self.foo:
                        # ... 
                        
                    # after this function is executed, foo is reset
                    # back to the default value (False)
