RobotPy Abstraction Layer (HAL) for WPILib
==========================================

Python wrappers around the HAL used by WPILib. This package is not useful by
itself, but requires a HAL implementation to also be installed.

HAL Implementations
===================

* robotpy-hal-roborio: interacts with the hardware on the roboRIO
* robotpy-hal-sim: designed for simulation and testing purposes

Installation
============

Typically, you don't install this directly, but use the RobotPy installer
to install it on your roboRIO, or it is installed by pip as part of the
pyfrc setup process.
